OUT OF ORDER: VR is removed.

<h3>
In the stream, you will see a little TV playing videos. This document will go over how to add videos to the TV.
</h3>
<h2>
Getting Started
</h2>
<p>
To request videos, you will need the ID of the video you will request. For example, the ID of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ is dQw4w9WgXcQ.<br>
<br>
There is no limit when it comes to videos except it must be less than 30 minutes. Please note that however, mods can blacklist videos we deem too inappropriate, or that it can get the stream striked.
