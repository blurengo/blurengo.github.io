How to fix "No results found" or requesting the wrong song
</h2>
<p>
Nightbot is picky when it comes to song queries. If you have issue requesting songs, this may help.<br><br>

#1: Go to the playlist. (!songs playlist)<br>
#2: Use the search function to look around for the song you want.<br>
#3: Copy the name of the song you want to request.<br>
#4: Paste it under !sr.<br>
</p>
