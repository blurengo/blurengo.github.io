On May 14, 2020, Nintendo surprise-dropped a trailer for a new Paper Mario game, Paper Mario: The Origami King.<br>
There are mixed opinions so far. One side thinks that this is an amazing new game. The other side thinks that this is Color Splash 2.<br>
<br>
Opinions aside, this is a new chance for the franchise as a whole. After the failures of Sticker Star and Color Splash, this can bring a new hope to the slowly dying series.<br>
<br>
Paper Mario: The Origami King releases on July 17, 2020. It won't be long until this new game gets in the hand of consumers.
