Are you hyped?:\n
https://www.strawpoll.me/20169713\nOn May 14, 2020, Nintendo surprise-dropped a trailer for a new Paper Mario game, Paper Mario: The Origami King.
There are mixed opinions so far. One side thinks that this is an amazing new game. The other side thinks that this is Color Splash 2.
\nOpinions aside, this is a new chance for the franchise as a whole. After the failures of Sticker Star and Color Splash, this can bring a new hope to the slowly dying series.
\nPaper Mario: The Origami King releases on July 17, 2020. It won't be long until this new game gets in the hand of consumers.
